These seeds, if left unchecked, grow into massive trees that could destroy the planet due to their size and invasive roots.

To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification, taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments. The principles of data protection should therefore not apply to anonymous information, namely information which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable.

To die: to sleep;\nNo more; and by a sleep to say we end\nThe heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks\nThat flesh is heir to, \"tis a consummation\nDevoutly to be wish\"d. To die, to sleep;\nTo sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there\"s the rub;\nFor in that sleep of death what dreams may come\nWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\nMust give us pause: there\"s the respect\nThat makes calamity of so long life;",

      "question": "Why did Jacek Soplica become Father Robak?",
      "answer": "Jacek Soplica became Father Robak to atone for his past sins, particularly the murder of the Horeszko Pantler, and to serve Poland in secret as a monk, aiding the patriotic cause against Russian oppression. Overwhelmed by guilt and seeking redemption, he joined a monastic order, adopting the identity of Father Robak to hide his past and work covertly to unite Polish nobles and support Napoleon’s campaign to restore Poland’s independence.",
      "relevant_contexts": [
        "Father Robak was such a monk. He tried to catch the Judge in private; afterwards, fresh news dispersed throughout the countryside. His bearing, though, was unlike Saint Bernard’s; new to the cowl, he hadn’t grown so old in cloistered halls. A scar above his ear extended to his brow; there was a bold lance-gash upon his chin, and it was clear he wasn’t wounded reading his psalter. His gestures suited life lived in a camp; when serving mass, and turning from the altar, his movement had a military stamp, a right face executed on command. (PAGE29)",
        "This monk cares less about the intercession of the Saints, preferring politics; and he is known to linger at the station, receiving letters that he quickly sticks inside his hood—dispatching messengers. At night he often sneaks out in the dark to nearby manor houses, where he whispers. Peasants drinking in taverns remark about his talk. The Judge will not refuse to let him in—surely he has some news. (PAGE29)",
        "And then one day a wandering monk appeared collecting alms. When he was satisfied the manor harbored no one to be feared, he removed papers that he’d sewn inside his scapular—coveted information, number of troops, the name of every legion commander, then victorious description, or else obituary. After uncertain years, a family might gain news of the glory or death of sons. (PAGE28)"
